# PushWeakest

Trigger the weakest cell every "n" iterations until the stress 
has reduced to a target value.
Triggering is also stopped when the last 10 triggers did
not result in an avalanche of at least size 2.

## job_branchsims.py

The start configurations "push = 0" are taken as the configuration after
a system-spanning event during normal (event-driven) simple shear.
The script `job_branchsis.py` takes care of this,
it generates a number of files `id=XXX_inc=X.hdf5` per `id=XXX.hdf5`.

## PushWeakest

The executable `PushWeakest` then applies pushes "push = 1, 2, ..."
to the integration point closest to yielding until nothing triggers 
anymore. 
The configuration at mechanical equilibrium, after each sequential push
is stored by means of the displacement field to `id=XXX_inc=X.hdf5`
(that contained the displacement before the first push already).
At the same time, the time evolution of each push is written to 
a separate output file `id=XXX_inc=X_push=X.hdf5`.
The latter can thus be regenerated by running one increment maximum.

## job_serial.py

To run on the cluster, `job_serial.py` can generate a single-CPU 
job per `id=XXX_inc=X.hdf5`. 
Note that it will automatically skip all files marked as 
completed.

## list_status.py

After a run `list_status.py` can be used to collect information
on all files `id=XXX_inc=X.hdf5` and `id=XXX_inc=X_push=X.hdf5`. 
It writes a file `list_status.yaml` that can then be use e.g.
to copy data.
